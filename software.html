    <h2>Mining Software Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting with the actual mining, it is important that a wallet is set up first so that your mining profits will have some where to go and you can make withdrawals
      and deposits. A few of the good wallets out there is the Coinbase wallet, Exodus, and Metamask. There are also physical devices called hardware wallets which is normally 
      in the form of a thumb drive and through USB or Bluetooth, you can access your funds from a computer and these types of wallets are safer but come at a cost. Sometimes 
      for people who do trading with cryptos on the market, they will mine directly to the wallet that is attached to the exchange they are using which is not so secure.
      <br><br>Below are a few of the common wallets many people use:
    </p>
    <h3>Online/Hardware Wallets</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Coinbase wallet</li>
      <li>Exodus</li>
      <li>Metamask</li>
      <li>Coinomi</li>
      <li>Mycelium</li>
      <li>Ledger Nano S</li>
      <li>Trezor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mining Pools</h3>
    <p>
      If there was a relatively new coin that was just released, it would not be such a bad idea to mine it individually. However, for many of the commonly mined profitable coins 
      it is common to find a mining pool so that you will have far more consistent gains. A mining pool is just a bunch of miners who "pool" their computational resources together 
      in order to increase the chances of finding a block. Each miner will get rewarded over time based on their computing power. Mining top cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, 
      and Litecoin usually requires you to be part of a pool unless you have a warehouse full of miners.
      <br><br>Below are a few of the common mining pools to use:
    </p>
    <h3>Mining Pools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ethermine</li>
      <li>F2Pool</li>
      <li>poolin</li>
      <li>2Miners</li>
      <li>Nanopool</li>
      <li>Antpool</li>
      <li>miningpoolhub</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To see a guide on how to get set up with the pool Miningpoolhub check under the <b>Helpful Resources</b> tab >>> <b>Setting Up Mining Pool</b></p>
    
    <h3>Miners</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NiceHash Miner</li>
      <li>CGminer</li>
      <li>Phoenix Miner</li>
      <li>Claymore Miner</li>
      <li>Cudominer</li>
      <li>LolMiner</li>
      <li>T-Rex Miner</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For starters, to get started with mining it is common to use <b><a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" target= "_blank">NiceHash</a></b> because it is well known due to its ease of use. 
      with its set-and-forget style of mining. NiceHash is is slightly different from a mining pool in that miners using NiceHash to mine are paid from a buyer of the computing power of the 
      miner. With Nicehash in particular, although you are mining Ethereum or some other coin for some pool, the payout will be in Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a user were to use a different miner such as Phoenix Miner and decided to mine using Miningpoolhub as the preferred mining pool, then the miner and the mining pool would have to support
      whatever coin the user is setting up the miner to mine.
      
      <br><br>To see what coins miningpoolhub supports, check out their website: <b><a href="https://miningpoolhub.com/" target= "_blank">miningpoolhub</a></b>. For any of the coins you click on, 
      there is a guide on what miner to use and how to properly set up whatever particular miner you decide to use for this mining pool.
