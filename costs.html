    <h2>Cryptocurrency Miner Build Costs Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is an overview of a low budget cryptocurrency miner where the parts can be purchased by most people for mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ravencoin. 
      A low-end GPU miner as of July 2022 can cost upwards to around $1,000 - $3,000 depending on the current market environment. Whenever there is a chip shortage prices 
      for GPUs can sky rocket and even old cards. GPUs such as the AMD RX 400 and RX 500 series can cost upwards to around $400 plus when normally they would cost $120 - $200.
      It may not be a bad idea to look around omline to get better deals on sites such as ebay when commonly used sites such as Amazon or Newegg are overpriced on their stock.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What Are We Looking For?</h3>
    <p>
      The motherboard will have 6 slots and each of them will be connected to 6 of the PCIe risers which will each have 6 RX 580 8GB GPUs in them. These GPUs are the primary 
      parts that are responsible for doing the work when mining and will be the most expensive parts of the build. It is important to note that depending on the power of your 
      GPUs, you may want 6 to 8 PCIe slots for additional cards. The PCIe risers are known to be the weak links for many miners and it would be a good idea to spend a little
      extra on these things as they are relatively cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this build is using low-end GPUs, a motherboard with 6 to 8 slots is recommended. The next imporant part is the power supply unit (PSU) to power everything, quality 
      is important with this part and a 1000 Watt PSU with atleast a gold rating is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the parts do not have to be of incredibly high performance. CPU mining was a big thing years ago, however it is now a thing of the past due to the difficulty of
      mining increasing and CPUs generally being weaker at doing the work required for mining when compared to a GPU. As long as the CPU can fit in the socket for the particular 
      motherboard you have, you are good to go. If you have an motherboard with a socket for for AMD CPUs and the socket is AM4, look for a cheap CPU compatible for AM4 sockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for memory, a minimum of atleast 8 GB of DDR4 memory is recommeneded. As long as the memory is compatiable for desktop and not laptops for this particular build, the performance
      of the RAM sticks is not important for a miner. A frame to hold everything together is usually preferred over a case to hold everything due to the temperature increasing while mining.
      For some people, they choose to simply hang their GPUs within a pet cage which can be arguably better when it comes to cooling.

      Before purchasing anything, it would be a good idea to calculate electricity costs as well as the profitability for the various GPUs out there when it comes to mining different coins.<br>
      A common website to use for calculating all of this quick is <b><a href="https://whattomine.com/" target= "_blank">WhatToMine</a>.</b><br>
      <br><br>Below is a table for the total cost of all the parts I found online:
